https://steamcommunity.com/id/Quamsi/recommended/2246340/,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):Positives-POOGIE IS BACKMonster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all thatOverall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.Negatives-Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening.I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time.The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both.To set it up:1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen.2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with.3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience).4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party.5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.EDIT:After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games.  Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.Update as of HR100/~60 hours in game:I was at steam review character limit so I put it on reddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j7acuo/",Recommended

https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRanger57/recommended/2246340/,"After 60 hours, hunting every monster, and hitting HR 75, I think I can say this is a good entry into the Monster Hunter franchise.The elephant in the room is of course being the performance and technical state of the game. Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There's no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that's not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.But dammit, this game is so fun. It's all I've been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.That being said, it's not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn't see much issue with the difficulty. I'm not a Monster Hunter expert, but I'm not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I'm sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well.But then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn't entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn't as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn't be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier.In general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don't see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.Arena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. (EDIT: Confirmed for title update 1!!)And then there's some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don't think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven't been buffed to match (yet) and it's starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that's available, so I can't say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can't deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when ""prep-time"" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever.That being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it's still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much. Looking forward to crown hunting (yes I'm crazy), updates, and Master Rank!",Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ya_mama--/recommended/2246340/,"To say I've put in quite a few hours over the past few weeks would be an understatement, so obviously I had a good time. If I take away some of my bias, it barely passes the recommended line though, and definitely with some caveats.Caveat 1: OptimizationLet's start with the elephant in the room. The game runs worse than QWOP. You need a top of the line rig and preferably 2 to 3 mods in order to ensure it runs smooth enough on higher graphic settings. If you own a more affordable PC, there are about 10 different optimization guides and a reddit megathreat to help you out with making the game playable.If that's not your cup of tea, don't buy the game until they fix this premium priced mess.Caveat 2: DifficultyI started with Monster Hunter Rise, and it was the same story back then. The new mechanic made the game too easy. Now I hear similar arguments about Seikrets making the game too easy.I think a lot of people understate the fact that escape mechanics are relatively trivial in the long run. When I started in Rise, I needed that escape to succeed quests. As I got more experienced at hunting monsters, it started to feel like an easy escape button. After hundreds of hours the ability became trivial since I had mastered my dodges and evades.When I started in Wilds, I very rarely used my Seikret escape button. It's because I came in with thousands of hours of experience. Experience that translates to this game, because at its core it's still a Monster Hunter game. As the title updates and eventually master rank will arrive, we will see a bump in difficulty, until we min-maxed those end game builds. Then everyone will be complaining again that it's too easy.I don't think the same applies to new players though, or the ones that play every now and then. Monster Hunter in general is very overwhelming if it's your first entry into the series, and I believe Wilds strikes a good balance between difficulty, survivability and most importantly...fun. There is very little that stops you from playing the game. There is almost always something you can do through skills, items or abilities.In other words, if you are a veteran looking for a difficult Monster Hunter game, I can't recommend this one. If you are new to series, and have a NASA PC at home, and are willing to install mods, I can recommend this game.Caveat 3: Purpose of Monster HunterI hear a lot of complaints about how the series is turning away from its original purpose. I can't account for that myself because this is my second Monster Hunter game. What I can account for is my own reason for why I boot up the game. It's to hunt monsters. And in my opinion, that's the most important part of a Monster Hunter game.Hunts may or may not last shorter. Tools may or may not be unlocked quicker. I don't know. What I do know, is that the fights are amazing. In between the 10 million stutters, frame freezes and disconnects of course. Whether that's 4 veterans absolutely destroying a monster, or just you, your weapon and your skills. There is also a good variety of monsters, given that this is only the starting roster.In order to get to the fun part you do need to put in some hours though. Monster Hunter is notorious for feeling clunky at first. There is a flow which most people only start to appreciate after they have spend a substantial amount of time with the combat mechanics. Once you have found the weapon that fits with your flow, hunts starts to feel like dances with the monsters, and it feels great. That's why I keep playing.If you're down for that, then I can recommend this game. Again, provided you have a NASA PC at home and a Nexus account for some optimization mods. If you are looking for elaborate preparation rituals and a deep understanding of the game in order to beat monsters, then this is not the game for you.Caveat 4: MultiplayerIf you want to play with friends, there are lobbies, squads, link parties, hunter friends and two different voice chat channels. It's a confusing mess. Once you know where to look it's quite simple of course, but you need a 5 step guide to help you do this for the first time.If you are more of a solo player, you can't cue up for SOS quests. Instead the game shows you a list of all the SOS quests that are ''available.'' You have to manually click on one, request to join, wait, click away a message that says you can't join the session, click away another message that says you can't join the quest, back out of the quest menu, select another quest from the list, and repeat the process. Just host your own quests, it's much better for your mental health.Story and MusicLastly I want to touch on 2 more points. The story is alright. It actually ties into the locales you visit and the monsters you hunt. It also has some cool lore bits if you are into that. But it's nothing to write home about. The monster themes on the other hand are absolute bangers.In ConclusionIf you want to have some fun hunting monsters with or without others, then I can recommend this game. It has a good starting roster of monsters and there is more to come. The combat will take some time to get used to, but after that there is a lot of fun to be had if you ask me. Even when you got fights down to a science. Aside from the actual fights, it has little else going for it. Hopefully, for now.However, the game is optimized so badly that I can only recommend it in good faith if you have a very solid PC. If that's not the case, I would wait until they have rolled out enough patches to at least make the optimization mods obsolete.Edits: spotted some grammar mistakes.",Recommended

But WHAT THE HELL is this lack of optimization and you trying to force Framegen on us? Not everyone is even able to use this tech. I saw how the game runs and looks on consoles, also not the best situation there.You'd think that the whole situation with Dragon's Dogma 2 would change smth for the better, and instead we have this.As of now, unless you have a beefy PC or an absolute MH fan, who'd play this game at a low locked framerate with possible sacrifices in terms of visuals, do NOT buy this game.

You just get on your mount, and it will carry you to your target automatically.Another aspects I like in Monster Hunter is how important preparation is, but in Wild, that doesn't realy matter. You forgot to bring a warming potion, oh don't worry, the game has you covered.I could write a lot of paragraphs complaining about how much easier this game is compared to its predecessor, but maybe people are tired of it.However after 80 hours. I finally realized that Wild is a better game for me, at least now, since I don't have much time to play games anymore, let alone having to hunt one monster for up to 60 minutes.I hope that with so many QOL's that make hunting easier, Capcom can balance it by providing new, more challenging monsters.",Recommended

I'm aware this isn't the first instance of new games having poor performance on launch, because the same thing happened with World, but it feels inexcusable at this point.I am by no means saying the game is bad, but in its current state, you should probably consider waiting for a more stable release.",Not Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/id/imptwins/recommended/2246340/,"This is being written before any of the game's major updates, about three weeks after launch. And it's being written by an insane old lady who started playing this franchise on her Playstation 2 in 2005, who cares about it more than she ought to. I also had a lot of fun in my 50 hours so far. Hitting 'no' on whether I recommend it isn't really a literal 'I do not recommend the game'. It also has nothing to do with the extremely valid criticisms of the game's extremely dogwater performance. Keep all that in mind.I don't think my take on Wilds is going to be a popular one, even with as many critics as it's building up. Which is fine, I'm used to that, World is the first time I've actually agreed with majority consensus on this franchise, while before that I would have still insisted Unite was the best in the series. That isn't a popular take. But I really can't help but feel like Wilds has gone in a bad direction for the long-term health of the series. Not because of the shorter hunts or the 'lack of content' that you may have already heard complaints about, especially that latter one. I DO think there's some truth to it, I think even at launch World had a lot more to do, but zero question that perception is mostly from people remembering World in its final state.My issue is that this game feels completely frictionless. The game doesn't feel like it ever stops me, it doesn't feel like it ever trips me up. Everything is so easy to do, not just the fights but supplies and food and inventories and unlocks and layered gear and, just everything. Your mount automatically sends you to where you need to go and everything you'd ever need is put in your pocket then the big monster dies after tapping you on the wrist a couple times and that's that. Even that example I gave before, there's just as many palico gadgets and we obviously still have a mount, but you just kinda. Get them. I didn't have to explore some weirdo unmarked nook of the map to do a weirdo unmarked quest for some random unmarked cats, I just kinda got it. Everything is laid out for you, handed to you.There's good and bad to the friction being gone. I love that sharpening is actually possible to do mid-fight solo now, but I feel like it's too generous that my seikret can just pick me up to bail me out of anything at all ever. I'm not going to miss Nergigante's 'roar which stuns you for long enough that you don't have time to sheathe your weapon to superman dive away from his now undodgeable attack' garbage, but I'm not sure I like that trade if it means NOTHING feels threatening. Nobody liked the old deco drop rates but... I dunno, it feels a little hollow finishing my build 50 hours into the game. Half of this stuff wouldn't be bad on its own, and half of it is actively good, but all at once? Remove ALL the friction, good and bad, at once? It makes it feel aimless, insubstantial, braindead. The game is so devoid of ANY sort of friction that I'm sitting over here feeling nostalgic about paintballs and mid-fight combining, for gods sake. Those were NOT good mechanics, but in a room full of padded walls I'm craving something concrete, something with some weight to it.I think my biggest gripe - and I KNOW this take is going to be super unpopular - is focus mode. I just don't think I should be able to throw out attacks nonstop without thinking about them and relying on focus mode's 180s to trivialize positioning. To me, the essence of monhun is the need for commitment, for planning, the fact that having to consider so many things regarding monsters and your own movement and positioning in advance not only necessitated deeply learning monsters' behaviours, but rewarded you massively for it. Landing a TCS on a mobile monster used to be a thing of mastery and beauty and now it's just... Nothing.The game honestly kinda feels more adjacent to Helldivers than World. A party game that exists purely for small groups of friends to roll loot slot machines in. And don't get me wrong, I like those kind of games, but that's not what monhun was to me.Regardless of whether future monsters do more damage and take longer to kill, that won't change the fact that focus mode makes positioning nearly redundant, that every single weapon has get-out-of-jail-free moves, that the big moves just aren't hard to pull off anymore given they're either twice as fast or have super armour or both and even if you do screw it up completely you can roll out of it before it's even gone off, that your seikret ensures it's nearly impossible to get combo'd out, that the absolute worst the game can do is put up a Quest Failed screen and take away the 5 mega potions you used on the fight from your stash of 800.I said at the start of this that I don't necessarily not recommend the game. But, at present, I would definitely recommend you to play World first. Too many edges got sanded down, I think. It's lacking the franchise's usual weirdness, and its abrasiveness. You can give the upcoming update monsters 10 times more HP, but it won't bring back the feeling of satisfaction that overcoming those rough edges brought.In retrospect Monster Hunter Wilds is a very ironic name for something that feels so completely toothless.EDIT: I did not expect so much attention on this, let alone for it to all be positive. Thanks for that! Especially the people sharing their old hunting stories, so, lemme share one of my own nostalgic hunting stories as thanks.I still hadn't 'got' monhun when Unite came out, despite playing 1, 2 and F2. Nargacuga was the flagship monster for that game and I really liked (and still like) its design. I got the quest to hunt it, suited up with my trusty old Akantor armour, and decided on dual blades for it. One of my weaker weapons but it felt appropriate. And, like, what's the worst that could happen? I wasn't even in G Rank yet.I drastically underestimated how tough a fight it would be, and wasn't nearly good enough with DB for it. I carted twice quickly just from being blindsided. I played safer from then but was still getting knocked around.I went through my entire potion supply. I kept fighting but got low on HP and ran off to actually use the tent to heal (a lot of people didn't even know you could do that in the older games lmao), and do some old fashioned on-field procurement of potion materials, despite being unfamiliar with the new map. I hadn't had to do that since monhun 1. I thought about going home for the hammer but despite the struggle I was just... having fun. It really did feel like I'd just met something that was my match and I had to knuckle down and learn it.I somehow managed to keep surviving, but the timer was becoming an issue. I'd barely even remembered quests had a time limit. I basically had no hopes for finishing it off, I was just keeping up the fight as practice. But I kept swinging when I could. Past 45 minutes I stopped going off to gather even when I fell into fatal range. And with literally less than a minute on the clock, it died. Out of almost all my supplies, battered and broken, hanging onto my last life by a thread, but I managed it.It's still my favourite monster hunter memory. As Wilds is, it's really hard to imagine it making a story, and a feeling, like this. World gave me some similar ones with some of the nastier monsters. Most of those memories were from Iceborne, though, so I do still think there's hope for Wilds to turn out some great moments with AT patches or the inevitable expansion, but like I say in the review, patches can up the numbers but they can't make Helmsplitter satisfying again.But also like I said in the review, I didn't really like the games between Unite and World much. It's not the end of the world if Wilds still winds up mid after everything. I waited 9 years between monhuns I actually liked before and I can do it again.Happy hunting, y'all.",Not Recommended

I just had to update my drivers and everything was perfect.Though I usually wouldn't focus on a Monster Hunter story, this one had me intrigued a little bit and kept me entertained throughout. The game really does open up once you finish the story though, so I can imagine a lot of other people rushing through it. Having the entire main story be put within low-rank was a good idea, as it's like the tutorial part of the game where you understand the mechanic of the monsters and how they work before going into high rank. You can also learn different weapon playstyle while going through the story.If you can get past all the optimisation issues, the gameplay is super fun and addicting, especially with all the different weapon playstyle. There's a playstyle for everyone in this game. A lot of improvements and new animations to every weapon from previous Monster Hunter games making gameplay feel fresh. The combat is as good as it gets for a Monster Hunter game.Playing with friends definitely make the whole experience better, though it isn't a must. There are support bots now when you send out SOS, and they can be quite OP. They're better than a big chunk of the player base in the game, and they can't die too which does in fact make the game too easy.

It's as if the MonHun team achieved a perfect difficulty for an experienced player and then said ""Great, now let's cut monsters' HP and damage by half"". Does this make the game less scary for newcomers? Yes, maybe even a bit too much. You can almost say that this is not just a good ""first Monster Hunter game"", it's a good ""first action game"". You can't win them all, Capcom knew that Wilds is going to sell millions so they decided to make the game very approachable on the difficulty front. However, if you're an experienced MH player, this results in very underwhelming fights - there is no struggle and there is no time to appreciate the design and the gameplay of the new monsters which are IMO much better than World's and Rise starting rosters. If you are on console/PC but not willing to tinker with the game, your options are:1) beating the monsters in good-but-not-very-satisfying 2-10 minutes fights throughout the whole game and only getting to the interesting encounters by the very end of the endgame with level-5 tempered monsters. The ""difficulty diamonds"" is a system that is supposed to give a challenge to people who want it, but IMO it should come into play from the very beginning. I don't really care that Low Rank is supposed to be easy - if I see a jaw-dropping cutscene of a monster that threatens the whole eco-system, I want to be scared of the mf and fight for my life. Give me this option without mods, Capcom.2) deciding to NOT use almost every mechanic of the game to create an artificial challenge for yourself. Never use palico, never eat anything beside a well-done steak, never use seikret in a fight, never upgrade your armor, never optimize your build... You can ""control the buttons you press"" only so much before you realize that you're actually avoiding 60% of the game to get an enjoyable experience. That's not how it's supposed to be.It's just the beginning of the 6th gen, and MonHun team is already aware of most of our complains. The fixes, the title updates and the major expansion with Master Rank will make this game an absolute all-timer. Until then, god bless the modders and I highly recommend you to try the game with 2xHP and 2xDamage multiplyer for monsters (1.4-1.8x if you're already in the endgame). I'm willing to tinker with the game and not just go back to World, because the fundamentals of Wilds are really great - the monsters are absolutely incredible, the locales are gorgeous (please explore them on foot, don't use Seikret all the time) and this is the first time when MonHun team really tried to tell a proper story. Is it good? Well, so-so. But the cutscenes are perfect and I sincerely hope that they will use this experience as a stepping stone for the expansion campaign to be much better.All in all, can't wait for the unavoidable Fatalis-level quest that will wipe us all. Happy hunting!UPDATE: Nevermind they added Lagiacrus this game is perfect.",Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/id/malrodin/recommended/2246340/,"Disclaimer: I played a ton of Monster Hunter so my thoughts come from that position. I'm not a 'purist' who outright dismisses modern MonHun, there's design decisions I have problems with but my focus is mostly on the product.I'm mostly comparing Wilds to World considering these are ""A team"" games (stuff like rise/sunbreak is the B team).4 key points: Content, Performance, Story, Gameplay.Content Is always iffy on new Monster Hunter releases. The games are being treated like Pokemon, with an eventual big update dlc/expansion basically making the game feel complete. This is one of the more unfinished feeling experiences I've had with Monster Hunter. I don't say this just from the wealth of Monsters to fight, Tri probably had less, but there's a lot of gaps particularily in the endgame. The fact that the open beta had you fight the de-facto final boss of the game is mad to me. I genuinely had my final boss fight before the game released, it was way harder too which was super satisfying once I beat it. The game is also pushing stuff that feels like it should be basegame into content updates. The first big content update is huge but it also definitely should have been there in the first place.Performance sucks. The game took 0 lessons from World (And the A team worked on this prior). There's just no two ways about it. You can watch someones youtube footage on a 5090 and they still get texture pop-in. World had massive performance issues at launch and the ones here feel especially eggregious considering World probably is a better looking game too. Try the benchmark.Story I'm only mentioning because of how forced it is. They definitely wanted to focus on it more this time around but the problem is that it's just not good. It's painfully formulaic and the twist in the middle actually made me laugh out loud with how silly it is. My multiplayer experience with friends was hampered multiple times by one of us having to go through a forced walk-and-talk that you cannot skip. I don't think a strong story would not work in a monster hunter, quite the opposite, but it's definitely not exploring anything interesting with the setting.Your character this time is fully voiced and also a total badass during cutscenes right from the get-go. Very hard to immerse yourself that way. I cannot understate how egregious it is that your character is being treated like a newgame+++ gigachad from minute 1. Usually monster hunter treats your guy fresh meat straight outta the academy, and you earn your badass status by working your way through challenges. Nata (the kid) gets introduced as the surrogate protagonist because you need a character who is even remotely vulnerable to have some stakes. The confrontation with the final boss may as well have had linkin park playing with how badass/edgy the setup was.Gameplay. Lotta things I could talk about here. There's plenty of smaller nitpicks between a really awkward multiplayer lobby system and questionable weapon balance, but if I had to summarize the biggest issue with Wilds it would be something like this:This is the Monster Hunter game where they want you to feel like a badass. Hunter movesets are far too powerful, Monsters did not compensate enough for this. You are consistently overpowering monsters at every stage of the game. As others have pointed out before, the game feels like you are beating low-rank monsters with high-rank gear. Hunter movesets were made to be a lot more mobile which is definitely fun, but it also means that positioning matters less. Why reposition for a big attack when you can just press the parry/counter that is completely reaction based, on a very very easy reaction no less. Parries definitely do not come at a premium in this one. A lot of talk was made about how the Seikret was an improvement over the wirebug from rise, but I think people underestimate how powerful the Seikret is. The game doesn't outright say this but you can get knocked down and still call your bird, completely saving you with plenty of invulnerability, making it functionally impossible to die given how calling it is free. This is by far the easiest monster hunter.My guess is this is also why the Story treats you like a badass from the get-go. I think this is a deliberate decision by the devs. This is the game about the power fantasy of being a monster hunter, but it feels unearned if the challenges aren't really there (or your character does something badass in a cutscene).The content and difficulty in this game are intertwined. The grind in Monster Hunter primarily functions as the endgame and replayability, giving you goals to do micro-optimizations to your gear, try different weapon loadouts, etc. Problem is they hand you everything way too quickly. An armorset can be completed in 2 hunts. Jewels you basically get shoved down your throat (and I didn't even do the farming exploit that was meta for a while). And why grind anyway if I'm already demolishing monsters. I don't really feel the improvements to my gear when fights are easy and they are still easy with better gear. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of the series, I'm not expecting to get challenged the same way here as I am with late-stage content of older games. But this is the only monster hunter where I just feel ""done"" with the game. I've seen it all.The future for this game is a little iffy. They clearly shipped the game too early and are introducing more stuff with their scheduled content updates. I'm not certain they will fix core issues with the game however. They talk about looking into balancing and I certainly hope their 'careful language' there will bring the overall powerlevel of hunters down, but I doubt it.  I'm probably coming back to it once the big ""rise2"" expansion releases, but until then, as I said, I've seen it all. I would still recommend this game as an entrypoint for newcomers if you have the PC hardware to properly run it. It's still monster hunter. It's still fun with friends and all. But after finishing wilds we went back to revisit sunbreak and had a much better time overall.",Recommended

https://steamcommunity.com/id/machomuu/recommended/2246340/,"OK so the performance is bad. I loved this game, continue to love this game, would recommend this game. It completely dismissed the worries I had after enjoying Rise so much that it'd have the same issues that World did.BUT I do have some thoughts. A lot of small problems that just make this game really frustrating. These are in no way deal breakers, and in fact half the reason they bother me so much is because I like the game, it's very good.Like first off, the story? Actually pretty good. I'm sure a lot of people probably skipped it and most people rushed it. The former's understandable, the latter feels almost intended for reasons I'll get to in a bit. Originally I was kind of annoyed because a sticking point I had with World was its emphasis on story, mainly because of how it portrayed it and how it was so intrusive. I figured, considering it was a big complaint for a lot of people, they would've cut down on it for this one. Instead they went the exact opposite direction and FOCUSED ON IT EVEN MORE. Now, again, I liked it, mostly because it had good pacing and the character dynamics were fun. It reminded me a lot of Monster Hunter 4's story, actually. There are some really good cutscenes and the ending bangs. Even if the dialogue can be pretty cheesily delivered (no shade to the VAs, they're excellent).My problem mostly came with the fact that the story progression and how the game is advertised kind of run in conflict with each other. This is only an open world Monster Hunter in the sense that loading screens aren't a thing when moving between most areas. If you try to explore this world, particularly early on, there are multiple times where you'll be stopped and railroaded into doing a story quest. For most of the game, there'll be no monsters outside of the ones you experience in the story, so the areas end up feeling barren. Even the systems that do exist when you venture outside without a quest are half-baked versions of what they become later. This is especially notable if you're playing with friends, because it can be kind of cumbersome to do the story together and assuming you haven't finished it and just want to play together, depending on where you are there might not be that much *to* do. Compare this to Rise or the classic monster hunters where when you get to a new rank usually you're just given a bunch of monsters to go hunt and it seems kind of odd given the open world is kinda the selling point of this game. You'd kinda expect that you could go out and fight a bunch of monsters rather than just being met with vegetation and the one or two you've unlocked. The story always auto running you to locations (especially ones you've already been through) and pulling control away don't exactly always make them an exciting proposition. Especially when you just wanna. Y'know. Hunt Monsters.Adding onto that, the UI in this game is. So bad. It's so bizarre, actually, because like...they had it figured out. Like, it was fine in Rise. Hell, I remember World's UI being better. But this game, I really don't know what happened. Visual clarity could be a loooot better, they've added menus menus and more menus, this game really loves its menus, the health bar is really small for some reason and the sharpness indicator doesn't have the same decrease feedback it did in previous games. Some things are just oddly presented in a way that feels like the developers thought it was obvious but I've seen enough people be totally stumped by to be pretty sure it isn't. I was actually so vocally frustrated during my time with this game, it's actually crazy that the UI is designed like this.Anyway, all of that sounds bad. And it is, I guess, but I feel like that's also maybe a testament to how good this game is. The story can be frustrating at times but the actual experience of it, despite the cons that come with it, was pretty nice and it doesn't outstay its welcome. You're always going to new places and meeting new people and monsters, and there are soooo many new monsters. And once it's done, the game ends up being exactly what you expected it to be. Exploring the world becomes fun and comfy and rewarding, so many quests pop up, etc. While I don't necessarily agree with this game taking the ""Low Rank is the tutorial"" idea to its logical extreme, I can at least say that what the game set out to deliver on it delivers on really well.Except the open world which isn't much of an open world. That's not a bad thing though, in fact I feel like this is the best case scenario for what this idea could have been. It feels very Monster Hunter.Also the fights in the story are reeeally fun. There were so many times where I was just saying ""THAT'S SO COOL"" while fighting, and I was actually kind of surprised at what they were willing to put in there in terms of difficulty. It's not hard, exactly, but it's more aggressive earlier than I'd expect (in a good way). Weapons are more versatile than they've ever been and even though seikrets can sometimes be a bit annoying to control (please for the love of god STOP MOVING), their functionality is really nice and they're set neatly apart from their predecessors, the palamutes. This game just adapts to the idea of being so on-the-go really well. Also it's really pretty, especially when the textures aren't taking forever to load in.I'm enjoying this game a lot, might honestly be among one of my favorites in the series (we'll give it some time). Yes, it has a lot of problems, technical or otherwise, but unless it just genuinely can't run on your computer then I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you do, though, be sure to make your voice heard. Problems can't exactly be fixed if they don't know about them.",Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058055476/recommended/2246340/,"Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:1. Performance, and fidelity.Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.2. Multiplayer cohesion.It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.3. Pacing.Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.4.  Difficulty.Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.5. Exploration.There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say""Hey, actually, please don't engage with me until the postgame, because every single system I'm built on is working together to make the process of getting there nothing but a chore.""It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality. Bless the artists, and the combat designers, but every director in charge of the rest of the game should be ashamed of the experience they've provided us.",Not Recommended

What's the point in offering ab optional high-quality texture pack as a DLC if texture streaming is so broken?I'm sorry, but I am done giving publishers a pass simply because I like their games.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/adventjx/recommended/2246340/,"PrefaceEver since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.PositivesCore GameplayThe core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.Multiplayer & QuestingThe lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""The MonstersThe bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.NegativesRepetitive Flow - For the first time everAlthough the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...Items and Builds - Unnecessary?I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.Lack of Central HubThe number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!Bland StoryIf I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.ConclusionFinal Verdict: 8/10 BAlthough the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption. Who knows? You might feel the same way, fellow hunter.",Recommended

https://steamcommunity.com/id/AJSADelrith/recommended/2246340/,"I love Monster Hunter. I have 3000+ hours across the recent titles. I played World/Iceborne on Playstation and then PC over again when the PC versions launched. I did the same for Rise/Sunbreak.I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.We lost SO many quality of life changes.---------------------------------Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.No idea what happened in testing.---------------------------------Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.---------------------------------The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?---------------------------------The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.---------------------------------The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.---------------------------------Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.---------------------------------There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days.  I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.---------------------------------Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.---------------------------------The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more  overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.---------------------------------The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.---------------------------------The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.---------------------------------I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.Monster Hunter fans will still find enjoyment in the game but the entire way through you'll probably be thinking ""I miss this"" or ""This is clunky"" or ""This was done better"" - and that's just sad to me.",Not Recommended

https://steamcommunity.com/id/furfagjenkins/recommended/2246340/,"Monster Hunter is my childhood series of nearly 16 years,Optimisations are not the sole issue.Performancehas beenunnecessarily poor for many people. However,fixing this will not solve the game's frustrating nature.Visual design is great. Combat has been truly impeccable. However, every other sect of direction has lain the devil in the details, creating a grossly obstructive and discouraging experience while taking multiple steps back from the whole series. It's clear the game is unfinished.As a whole package, when only one of the main components established over 20+ years is done well and worthwhile side content is summed up by 'the fishing's kinda cool now', there is a huge problem.So TL;DR: Roundabout and cluttered UI,a gutting of series mechanics without fun, appropriate replacementsand a story whose beats are brief and forgettable on purpose, yet is frustratingly paced, stretched and ground down rails like something worth telling - handholding far exceeding time actually spent hunting. Insult to injury comes from ignoring Rise for an obtuse multiplayer worse than World's painful 'leave and restart the quest to let friends join' system.All to imprison you in a title whose major innovation is finally being open world for 'player freedom'.So how does this begin to come together?On UI:Try adding a friend you already know through this game without joining the same lobby. There's no dedicated ""Friends"" menu. You will probably take 10 minutes. Wanna play together? Go to the same lobby. Now you need a link party. Now you need to...It isalla sub menu jungle: poorly planned, explained and labelled.More importantly, there's a HUD ripped from a 'corporate open world slop' mockup you'd find around Elden Ring's release. Most of it can be customised, but there's a beady, omnipresent and unremovable objective marker, duplicated on the un-customisable minimap telling you where everything is through visual barf; it all blends together.These features are notorious for stealing your attention from a game. Perhaps forgivable elsewhere, but 2 of Monster Hunter's core components are attacked by this. One by being cheaply replaced. It actuallystrips the series' special identity.What are they and why are they important then?1)Preparation.Straight forward step. Pick out your items and equipment. Eat. Head out. It's a light strategic phase relying on memory and your personal preference. Without it you make life 10x harder.2)Scouting and foraging.Huge part of what makes MH special. Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.3)Tracking.Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.4)Combat and chase.Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.So which of these are attacked exactly?Scouting:Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.Tracking:This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why?Well there's a clear rework they could've done:Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking,why wasn't the level design built with engaging stalking in mind, where some monsters only stayed to fight or could lose their special power if we snuck up on them first?What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring.""Monster Brawler"" is not the name of the series.Anything else of value?Each of these are so far absent:-Home customisation-Endemic life as pets-Mounts engaging in combat-Collectables-RaidsCooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)But the combat's still good, right? How does this affect me?Lazy choices disrespecting core identity lead to lazy choices disrespecting you and this is present throughout. Not just in boring navigation, backwards menus or some nightmare 4-5 steps with recursive loop to playing multiplayer with friends. So how does combat fare...?Low Rank is Hell.The mind-numbing kind.1)A top complaint is hunts being too short.The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.2)Build crafting.Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds howyouwanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.3)Then there's the story.World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine howshortthe hunts are and the bore drills deep.So what's the recurring problem here?Everything is designed to stop you engaging with the game, both implicitly and explicitly. Going so far as to hollow the experience out and prescribe you a narrow vision on how to interact until finally opening up by endgame. Dozens of hours in.Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more.

And here's why:Since I'll be the one with 5,000 hours in Wilds, just like I did in World, I need to be strict and not deny what's wrong with the game (even if I'm not suffering from it). I only play while I'm live on Twitch, and having an active community of people that LOVE the franchise, hearing so many bad things about performance, makes me not want to recommend the game, only for that reason. But there's more that I'll discuss later. It's unacceptable to buy a game that has been promised to us for so long and not be able to play it, even when we have the PC config to do so.Apart from not being able to run the game, we now need to be CAREFUL with performance MODS because for some obscure reason, Capcom decided to HUNT and PERMANENTLY BAN whoever they please, even if the person is not cheating, without giving a reason AND without letting the person prove that they didn't cheat in the game, and only used tools to RUN it properly. QoL mods, tools such as FOV editor and ReShade WILL BE FLAGGED as CHEATS if Capcom wants, and their word is the last. That's abuse of power and should be UNACCEPTABLE by us, consumers. WE bought the 10 million copies in the first month. WE made Wilds break records. Not the investors, so STOP PLEASING THEM.We need CLARITY in communication with players, us, the FANS who will be playing for hours on end. We will consume and be affected by shady communication, obscure reasoning and abuse of power without even being able to prove that Capcom is wrong.Capcom, listen. Remove ARENAS from Wilds, focus on making meaningful content. Stop targeting mods. Cheaters CANNOT do ANY harm to ANY player. If there's more rewards than normal on a quest, people shouldn't enter it. If someone hit kills a monster, the person should quit the game without saving. Besides that, this game is 100% PVE and NO CHEATER can do ANYTHING to get to anyone. Rethink your actions, innocent players do not need to be afraid of enjoying the game that they bought with their own money. No one cares about leaderboards.

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025783534/recommended/2246340/,"What's so strange about this game is, they've sanded it down with the intent of finding an even broader audience, but the result would be mystifying to me if I was a new player. The game picks a healing item for me automatically, so what is the point of the plethora of different healing items? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) Sharpening my weapon just amounts to pressing a button whenever I remember it, so what is the point of the sharpening mechanic? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) You can beat any fight with any equipment, so what is the point of all these complicated weapon stats? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) It feels like, if Capcom were designing this game from scratch, 75% of these systems wouldn't even be in it. Because they all add friction and Capcom doesn't want there to be any friction any more. In that sense, it's kind of a mess.Beyond that, the point about the equipment sums up how Wilds has broken the loop that made previous MH games so satisfying (already an issue in Rise but absolutely terminal here). Your impetus for hunting the same monsters again and again is supposed to be that you NEED those materials to win your next fight – and you need to master your weapon for the same reason. But in Wilds none of that matters. I will admit that combat feels great. But WINNING doesn't feel great, because it's no longer the culmination of anything except mashing buttons. The reason I want a real challenge isn't to prove how skilled I am, it's because a challenge makes you engage with the game more deeply, and so gives you a richer, more sustained experience, which you think about even when you're not playing. Without that, you're left with a nicer-looking but much shallower retread of Monster Hunter World, and that hasn't been worth £60 to me. And even if they redeem it to an extent through title updates and DLC, that won't restore purpose to all these legacy mechanics that now drag behind the game like a dead limb.",Not Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040962204/recommended/2246340/,"As someone who has been playing the Monster Hunter series for 20 years, this is easily the most disappointed I've been in a MH release.Performance issues aside, they have dumbed down the series to cater to a greater audience. I guess people got tired of hunting monsters in a Monster Hunter game, so Capcom decided to turn them all into loot pinatas which are mostly stagger-locked due to the new wounding mechanic.While the new movesets and mechanics like offsets and power clashes feel great, it feels like there's barely any time to get into the heat of combat when hunts are over in 5-7 minutes. With focus mode, you no longer need to worry about positioning or waiting for openings as you can brute-force every monster in the game. Hunters have more tools and much expanded moveset/mobility to deal with threats but monsters seem to have lost the majority of theirs - wind pressure, tremor, blights barely exist in the game and/or have little to no impact. Roars no longer open you up to follow-ups and it is near impossible to get stunned.I understand a chunk of the difficulty from older titles came from overall jank and funky hitboxes (plesioth, I'm looking at you!) and the games have gradually become easier as we see more QoL come to the series, but Wilds is in a whole different league of ease even when compared to base World and Rise.Playing with skills and creating builds, which is a huge part of the game for me, has never been more dull. Decorations are now split into weapon and armor categories with 99% of the offensive skills being locked to weapons. Most armors have purely defensive/utility skills now so no more crit/attack/element or even guard skills are on armor. Weapons from the weapon tree now come with a built-in skill or two, but several are essentially useless (like draw skills on lances and focus on glaives) and as a result, your build variety is incredibly limited. I feel like it was set up this way to deal with the new system allowing you to equip 2 weapons at the same time - which in itself is pretty pointless when hunts are over in under 10 minutes and you can literally fast travel to a camp WHILE IN COMBAT. The only time I've swapped weapons is to greatsword a sleeping monster or swap elements for 2-monster hunts. That aside, the armor and weapon designs are fantastic.At first glance, the world seems grand and robust with plenty to explore, but the entire map is uncovered as you enter the zone. Exploration only goes skin-deep as you are forced use your seikret to traverse certain areas and what you're left with is a lot of big empty spaces. There's no sense of world when your dino chicken mount just auto pilots you everywhere as you drive-by gather. The environmental/weather changes are cool at least and there's some neat ecosystem stuff to explore but the zones themselves felt very washed out, drab and weren't memorable at all, but scarlet forest is cool at least.There is currently no real form of endgame or reason to play after killing the last tempered monster as you will likely get all the mats you need in 1-2 hunts. You don't even need to grind rubies anymore as investigations offer guaranteed ones.I was finished with the game around the 40 hour mark, including the 'endgame monsters' and making their sets. I did not skip story or cutscenes either. Any gametime after this was mostly hanging out in chat with friends, helping them or idling. I want a reason to play more but there is no sense of progression or something to build towards.The game is very hand-holdy with Alma (your handler) constantly remarking the same line for tempered monsters, reminding you to carve tails and that you can carve small monsters and most of the story consists of on-rails walk and talks. There is also a very, very annoying notification system that constantly bombards you with less than useful info. I don't need to know that there's an upsurge of thunderbugs or that the Chatacabra 1km away somehow got blinded. The button to dismiss these notifications is the same one to open your map, and you can't open the map until they're dismissed. Also the UI is a horrid mess full of nested menus - and while you CAN customize them, I just couldn't be bothered.All in all, MH Wilds has a lot of questionable design choices that are at odds with itself and the game feels rushed. Aside from bowguns, the new weapon movesets look and feel great. Focus mode/wounds need some serious re-balancing and despite them focusing heavily on an ecosystem, the world feels mostly dull washed out.This is the first Monster Hunter I have ever not recommended.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/Skyblade799/recommended/2246340/,"BIG UPDATE:IT'S NOT WORTH THE PRICE: IT'S SHORT. IT'S REALLY SHORT (and easy)!I didn't expect that, but I beat the game having left it up for at least 5 hours, and 16 hours of those were low-rank/campaign cutscene heavy play, leaving around 19-20 hours of actual gear grinding and monster fighting, but with almost none of the decision making I would expect for the gear.It indeed is very easy too (just as others said it was); I've beaten every boss in the game and only maybe have a few tempered enemies less to beat, and I've carted/died maybe 3-4 times? There's not much reason to grind except to pass the time (which I probably will just to get the money's worth), as with a max tier hammer AND dual blades already equipped as of beating the final boss, I would just be grinding for random decorations and the goofy ""Artian""/ random weapon stat parts system for the hell of it - not because there's any actual progression left. Not like I just rushed either; this is just from playing to get the hunter rank to actually fight said final boss.I kind of blame this on them putting all defensive jewels on armor, and all offensive ones on weapons, thus leaving nothing left on the armor except stamina/defense/evade window (and maybe the set bonuses I don't have reason to get at this point)? They added weapon swapping, but didn't think through the effects of changing the gear systems so poorly to match.Even issues from the original review I made (that was under halfway through) still ring true:1:It's not well optimized. I'm not having issues, but just by looking at my own performance metrics (on a beefy computer) I can see how much it's using up for a game that really, really shouldn't be. It's no wonder many are having problems right now.2: The UI is awful for no reason. Tons of games have done the MMO styled inventory UI, maps, controls, etc. all better than MH has over the years.3: the game is terrible for co-op. You have to do some kind of wonky thing where you invite people to a ""link group"", and then to your environment in order to properly quest in the same party/town. It works story quests, but figuring it was is a nightmare, where you need everyone to go enter the quest and go through the cutscenes until it says ""quest started"" and then you need to actually join someone in your link group (abandon the quest) just to actually join them, but it does thankfully count for progress. Seriously clunky.4: A lot of moveset complexity is missing. No stance swapping or wirebugs from Rise (same with palico skill customization). The weapon swapping is indeed nice and allows for swapping up builds to strengthen the other (like poison application into a weapon swap while it's ticking away), but it's not quite the same thing if you are dedicated to a weapon I suppose, as all that second weapon lets you do then is swap an element and that's it. No extra capabilities or options to freshen up the fights, so every fight feels the same in terms of what moves you make.5: It's ""open world"", but the campaign is an awful, linear boredom fest with a giant pile of slow auto-walk sections (and I do mean it's actually automatically walking your forwards at a certain speed). Cutscenes I couldn't skip fast enough with character designs picked out of a roulette wheel. Plus, by the time you get to high rank and actually just get to go out and hunt.... if you fight the wrong/higher rank monsters lying out in your world, the game just tells you that ""you can't"" and if you kill them yoi get no quest reward. Why even spawn then in your co-op game if you and your friends can't be rewarded for that yet? Why make it open exploration at all? What does it do other than reduce performance. To make it EVEN worse, I'd argue that the map design is much less well designed and smaller than world for each area, much less vertically capable, and in general just not as good as either. Seems like they focused too much on interlinking everything than they did making it good, which reminds me of that DLC area from Rise that was trying to be everything, but ended up being a bit unrefined.6: The inventory management is awful. Constantly have to go to the camp box to store excess items, and the game expects you to get them, or else you won't be able to craft anything. No way to auto-send easily like in Rise it seems? It does get sent to your box if you are full on picking up something, but you have to awkwardly go through confirmation prompts and a menu that forcibly pops up every single time you grab something in that case (even when grabbing with the grappling hook), which is bad for the flow of the game.Compared to the other MH games I've played (World & Rise)? It's a fun game, but It's much less of an improvement than I'd hoped over World. In-fact, I dare say it's actually just a side grade.... or worse. Rise lost a lot of world design but gained a lot of mechanics development... but here, we got nothing really, and some things became less interesting overall. Even rise had many more monsters on release, and rise added a lot of new combat mechanics and features even if added less monsters. This was made in the same exact engine and clearly uses a lot of the same monster move-sets and everything (and doesn't even look great for the performance), so I'm surprised they don't just have more monsters from world in here to help improve the content limitations given they would just need a visual fix-up. I was expecting more with this being a major mainline entry and not the mobile console release rise was, but here we are.Everything is weaker; the roster, the weapon depth, the armor decisions to be made based on build... even the end grind isn't particularly exciting to think about with no real goals, or even cohesion; my game winning build is 5 evade window and some stamina/recovery up an any hammer/dual blades I feel like, and I just cobbled it together randomly as I played with no thought. The areas are less interesting, there's less depth to palicos/movesets/secret collection... in fact are there even any secrets to find like the little critters in Rise? The few secrets I found just had a lot of random collectable trade items in them, which are only for use in the overly simple cooking buffs (where there's also really no decisions to be made). Man, even the little cooking animations are worse; who just fries a whole quarter of a head of cabbage/lettuce like that and bites it off a knife?It isn't worth the price; fun, but on a sale (probably for around $30-40, not 70 or higher). If you are planning on playing it regardless of that (or from a later sale), make sure your computer can actually handle it, and for co-op... wait for some guides on how that even works (if at all for the story). A lot more of a mess than it should be right now.Hopefully some non-DLC updates add something, because I definitely struggle to recommend it if you are here for the gameplay with that practically ""Path of Exile"" level waste of a campaign dragging it down for the first half, and the lack of interesting design or even content in general or in the second half.",Not Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/id/ILoveRaidenMei/recommended/2246340/,"Product received for freeBefore getting into this review I just wanna point out that I, by no means, hate the game. I actually like the game a lot, however it has some very substantial flaws that I wanna talk about.I usually don't write reviews so there will probably be a lot of ranting or I will go off topic etc, however I just felt like I had to voice my thoughts on wilds as a long term monhun player (started with P2ndG and played almost every main title past it, except for tri and the Japan exclusives.)TL;DR at the bottom btwTHE GOODI'll start by talking about the good points of monster hunter wilds.The game is fununfortunatelywhich is usually a good thing. However in wilds' case it isn't, since the game severely lacks in variety and content which I will talk about later. The game introduced a new combat mechanic, the focus mode, which is surprisingly fun to use and definitely an improvement from the clutch claw from world and the wirebugs from rise despite it being overpowered. The open world is definitely something monster hunter needed as it emphasises the whole hunter aesthetic and is a cool concept and way better than having to load into a new zone every time a monster decides to run away. The combat and fluidity of weapons is surprisingly good, even though they made some rather questionable changes to some weapons.That, however, is all I can really give this game in terms of good points..THE BADLet's start by addressing the elephant in the roomTHE PERFORMANCE. Holy hell did Capcom mess up the performance in this game.My computer is pretty decent I'd say and is not very old (around 2 years). Despite that however, I can only really manage to get around 50 to 60 FPS at most, with low settings, DLSS on performance etc. I usually get around 120 FPS in most games that I play. It's just horrendously bad compared to rise and even world, a game that had performance issues as well (Fun fact: before I got my current computer, I played on an actual potato: 8 gbs of ram, a very old 1050 ti, some random i5 processor and some broken hdds. But even on that computer I could reach around 50 FPS in world on medium settings.)Obviously, I could always just upgrade my computer, but that wouldn't really fix the root of the issue and is not really necessary. The reason why the performance in this game is such a mess is because Capcom decided to make this game in the RE engine for some reason, an engine designed for Resident Evil games. And even in those games there were performance issues to my knowledge.They did make some performance improvements compared to the beta however, they're barely noticeable.Second of all, the graphics in this game are also quite a let-down. The game looks worse than world, a game that came out around 7 years ago and Capcom somehow managed to make half the game look blurry or like a PS1 game. I'm usually not really a graphics guy, but I thought it'd be good to point out.Next up, thecontent.Content has always been a very big part of monster hunter. You could pump thousands of hours into these games without ever getting bored, be it the base game or the g rank version. They toned down a bit on that with worlds and rise which is ""fine"" albeit disappointing. Yet this game somehow manages to have no content at all.You're probably asking yourself right now: but we have tempered and frenzied monsters. How is there no content??? Well, it's quite simple, most monsters aren't really relevant for the end game. In fact, Arkveld and Gore Magala are the only monsters that are really worth killing. Apart from that, you're really just playing the game for the sake of forcing content.Frenzied monsters used to be such a massive thing in MH4 and MH4U, but they're a complete joke in this game. It's like they turned a hydrogen bomb into a coughing baby. They are so over-nerfed, they can hardly be called frenzied monsters anymore. We don't even have apex monsters (yet).And tempered monsters are just tempered monsters but also somehow weaker. I've always had my gripes with tempered monsters, since they're essentially just ""artificial"" difficulty and therefore not really a new fight. They're just the same monster, but with more health and damage. But even they got nerfed and are barely recognisable from world. This, combined with the fact that the overall difficulty in this game is below average and elder dragons being completely non-existent, makes for a very lacklustre gamein terms ofdifficulty.So when you are done with the game and finally reach the end game you are basically just hunting Arkveld again, again, again, again, again andAGAIN. Maybe splash some Gore here and there and that's it. There is no reason to hunt any other monster besides them, which sucks, because they added some really cool new monsters e.g: Rey Dau or Jin Dahaad (even though I'm not a big fan of these big one-shot mechanics).Hunting Arkveld is fun, but it just gets tiring and boring after the 100th Arkveld and, unless you are a content creator or speedrunner, there is little to no reason to hunt so many Arkvelds. Sure, you could just try to complete all the achievements, which will keep you busy for a while, but there are only so many achievements you can get and achievements should never be the main appeal of a game. It should be thegameplay or gameplay loop.And lastly but not least, another thing I wanted to address is the story. Jesus bare with me. The story is pretty much just 60% cut scenes until one of the npcs runs into trouble, and you have to save them from a monster. It's boring, insufferable and just unnecessarily forced upon you. If you play monster hunter for the story, then that's good for you. Most monster hunter players however, don't care about the story (story =/= lore btw) and just want to hunt old and new monsters. So having to go through hours and hours of dialogues and cut scenes just so that you can hunt 1 monster is very irritating. At least world's story has some good memes.CONCLUSIONI could go on and on and also talk about weapons and some other things, but I think I got most of the points and what I wanted to say across.All in all, I'd say the game is pretty good in terms of gameplay. The loop however, is quite lacking due to the bad end-game. As of writing this review, I sadly can't recommend the game to anyone as it feels VERY rushed and incomplete. Here's to hoping the TUs are good and not just one monster at a time.TL;DRThe gameplay is good. The graphics, performance, end-game grind, story, challenge and content are bad as of writing this review.",Not Recommended

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137768964/recommended/2246340/,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.Difficulty:I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.Weapon and combat changes:Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]Content and pacing:I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasn’t really in much of a rush. What’s arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.Monsters:The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space they’re gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.The environment:It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.My general opinion:This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne.",Not Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072437110/recommended/2246340/,"As someone who has put over 5000 hours into this franchise since Tri on the Wii and fully completed every entry since then, I never thought I'd actually have to do this but this game simply deserves a negative review. The state of the PC version alone is already a massive disappointment and personally I have never played a more broken game at launch than this one. Sure, my i7-9700k/RTX 2080 PC is a bit old now but it's still above Capcom's own ""Recommended"" specs and performance that doesn't match the visuals on display is far from the only issue. Textures not loading is a very common problem even among friends with a much better PC and there's a lack of polish overall with bugs like a certain large icy monster spawning in a ""T-pose"" almost every time. To top it all off, Capcom continues to think it's a great idea to burden an already terribly optimized game with DRM to make everything even worse for us paying customers.That said, I wish the technical aspect was my only complaint but all it's done is make the other lacking parts of the game harder to swallow. Capcom clearly wants that mainstream money now and that goal for mass appeal bleeds into every aspect of the design. The cringe storytelling and the way you're pushed through it to make multiplayer a pain makes for an annoying earlygame but once the dust settles in High Rank you have time to truly observe how far Wilds already is from what Monster Hunter used to be. Monsters - despite their cool new designs - are glorified loot pinatas that are extremely easy to overpower with the wounds mechanic that is way too potent. Veteran players will know about the back and forth ""dance"" you have with monsters while fighting them but in Wilds there's nearly none of that left. Even the loot itself feels as worthless as it ever has. As someone with terrible luck, I was initially happy seeing investigations with guaranteed gems in their rewards...until I realized just how common they are and how a single one can provide 3! guaranteed gems to you and your friends whenever you like. It's all just so meaningless and way worse than the old ""pity"" system where you could trade for a rare part you just can't seem to get with a limited set of tickets.Then you get to crafting your gear which has some genuinely awesome designs. Mission accomplished, right? Well no, because then you realize how limited you are in this game with skill choice because they split skills into weapon and armor categories. At first I thought this might be a balancing answer to the skill bloat from World/Rise but it really does just restrict you and make things way simpler. Bowguns have it the worst here, being forced to live with ammo capacity, recoil and reload speeds (No, Opening Shot sucks) that I wouldn't have wished on my enemies in past games. This redesign just isn't fun and hurts these weapons way more than just toning down their damage output and looks even more pathetic when compared to some quite frankly insane things the melee weapons get for free in their base kits in this game. Bow may as well be one of them too now, gaining infinite coatings to support the playstyle change started in World from carefully placed charged shots to spamming as many arrows as possible.Even the food skills have lost a lot of their meaning. You no longer eat for every hunt to accommodate the layout of this game and the skill selection reflects that. Barely any minor optimizations or boosts for the weapon types you use are left and the best sources of food give you access to more loot and free insurance so there's even less risk if there ever was any? Wow, what a deal! Why even bother with anything else? It's fine though, it's not like you can even check what the random food skills you get might do because someone forgot to add a button to look at things in the menus. Speaking of which, I'm still baffled how they messed up menu/UI things they've solved in previous entries. Why are there no damn equipment/item boxes for easy access? Why does it have to take so long to speak to Gemma and look at weapons and why does skipping the only forging animation you've seen dozens of times already take longer than it should? Why is the wishlist so ineffective at highlighting what you're missing in the total materials when Rise had it perfect? These kind of irritations add up over extended play and somehow Capcom didn't notice these flaws in their quest to streamline everything even more.The world itself is quite boring despite being fairly varied and the cool concept of changing environments. Early on, you have no incentive to go out and explore with the restrictions of the story and because it's simply not necessary to progress. No time to smell the roses, just keep pushing on from one area to the next at max speed. But even later on, why bother learning the layouts when your mount will just autopilot you anywhere you want to go? World's exploration felt more meaningful than this and Rise was a lot of fun to navigate with the Wirebugs.The soundtrack is quite a disappointment compared to the rest of the series, as even World had a fantastic score aside from the absolutely trash regular quest clear theme. This OST has some moments, but it's all so unmemorable and ambient. The quest clear theme here doesn't even get remotely good until nearly a minute in, so captures will never get there while also being in a game where you can skip ahead. But it all makes perfect sense. Clearing a quest is no longer an accomplishment or special in any way, so the music used reflects that. No fanfare, just go on to the next one with the new skip feature.Finally, in terms of content there is much to be desired here that's expected of a Monster Hunter entry. The game is basically over in record time after Low Rank, you can't re-fight the ""final boss"" and there's not even a real spectacle/siege fight. Where's my Dragonator?? Where is anything, really? No Ballistas or Cannons, no real Arena or Arena Quests or you know, a multiplayer hub which is only one of the most important things in the series. The fact that they felt comfortable pushing that into a title update says it all, really. The series keeps moving more and more into the ""live service"" territory and I hate to see it when the base game is so barren at launch. In my eyes, the base game should be complete on Day 1 and have next to no title updates to save as much as possible for the expansion but it's too late for that now. Capcom got away with it and will use the title updates to maybe fix/finish the game (hopefully at least one of those) while trying to keep engagement numbers high to boost sales of their stupid cosmetic DLCs before starting the hype cycle for the expansion.This series is no longer for the people who kept it going all those years and while there is still fun that can be had along the way, it's losing more and more of the essence that made it satisfying in the first place. There definitely are a lot of areas that updates and the expansion can and surely will improve on, but some parts of its overall design just aren't fixable. I still have some faith in the portable team to give us a well-optimized entry for the Switch 2 (that will scale up nicely to stronger platforms) which will at least TRY to keep some of the classic spirit of the series alive just as Rise/Sunbreak did despite their flaws. If they don't, then I'll have to consider replaying older entries (that they probably don't want to remaster either because then they'd have to sell a complete Monster Hunter game with no DLC galore) or just moving on entirely from (what perhaps used to be) one of my favorite franchises.",Not Recommended

https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031953257/recommended/2246340/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefully with some updates my review might change.The GoodLet’s start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, that’s actually a highlight.)The IssuesHowever, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they won’t fix the game’s more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.UI and NavigationThe user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The game’s multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than World’s already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.Loss of Core Monster Hunter IdentityMonster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.Low-Rank Experience and StoryEarly-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.What’s Missing?Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:No home customizationNo endemic life as petsNo meaningful mounts in combatNo significant collectiblesNo raidsCooking lacks variety compared to previous titlesThese missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.The VerdictMonster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles.",Not Recommended

It feels really good, more fluid than world.In the benchmark and beta, my performance was tolerable, enough that I was worried. have a 7800xt and a 5700x3D. I'm running 1440p on ultra, AMDfsr 3 and frame gen are on, I'm sitting above 100FPS. So far aside from a couple hitches and stutters that I'm pretty sure are cache related, the game is running solid.HOWEVER, I KNOW that if I didn't have FSR3 and Frame Gen on, I would be struggling to get above 60FPS. These tools should be used so lower spec PCs can get in on the fun and instead they're flat out required to make the game run decently.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/yahrii/recommended/2246340/,"Monster Hunter Wilds had a lot to live up to, especially after the success of World and Rise. After spending over 60 hours in the game, I have a lot of thoughts. Some things are fantastic, others are frustrating, and a few are just downright disappointing.At its core, Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game, which means the thrill of the hunt is there. The weapons feel great, the monsters are well-designed, and the gameplay can be really fun. But… there are some major issues that hold it back. So let’s break it down.Gameplay - Fun in Its Own WayMonster Hunter Wilds delivers a solid gameplay experience that feels unique and engaging. Despite its flaws, I find myself enjoying the core mechanics, and there’s definitely a lot of potential here.Weapon Improvements - A Step ForwardOne of the best things about Wilds is the weapon system. Every weapon feels like a refined and improved version of its Monster Hunter World counterpart. The movesets, mechanics, and overall polish make them incredibly satisfying to use.Combat - Slow and Clunky Compared to RiseComing from Monster Hunter Rise, the combat in Wilds feels painfully slow. Rise had a level of fluidity that made the hunts exciting and dynamic, whereas Wilds feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn’t even come close to the sheer fun factor I experienced in Rise.Multiplayer - No Real Sense of CommunityTechnically, there are plenty of ways to communicate, but the problem is nobody does. The game doesn’t naturally bring players together for multiple hunts; instead, it has this vague ""join a party"" option, which almost nobody uses.Right now, it's basically: play with real-life friends or hunt alone with randoms who join through the SOS system. There’s no real way to meet new players organically, no sense of community where you can team up for an entire evening, discuss tactics, or just chat about real life. The old hub system encouraged bonding and teamwork—Wilds completely lacks that, and it really hurts the multiplayer experience.Graphics - Unacceptable for the System RequirementsThe visuals are an absolute disaster considering how demanding the game is. It feels like a downgrade from Monster Hunter World—everything looks blocky and grainy. At first, I thought it was an issue on my end, but after checking the forums, I realized this is a widespread problem. For a big company like Capcom, this is just unacceptable. My PC is well above the recommended requirements, yet the game still looks underwhelming.Modding - Almost a NecessityAs it stands, mods feel like a requirement to make the game look decent. The fact that the community has to step in and fix visual issues that shouldn’t exist in the first place is frustrating.Typos in the Config Files?!This one is just baffling. There are actual typos in the config .ini files. It’s a small issue, but it speaks volumes about the lack of polish in some areas.Final VerdictDespite all its issues, the gameplay itself is REALLY good. But right now, it just barely makes up for the game's many shortcomings. Capcom needs to step up and fix these problems, because as it stands, Wilds is a flawed but enjoyable experience.",Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024992671/recommended/2246340/,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours.",Recommended

Lets go over the pros and cons:Pros:Game play - Come on, this one is a given. It's monster hunter. Monster hunter will deliver you super rewarding game play as you hunt monsters, farm materials, craft epic gear and upgrade it over time. Play with friends and go on a hunt together to tackle all kinds of bosses from smaller enemies to gigantic apex predators. I don't think I ever had a boring moment in this game aside from some of the dialogue which we will get into.Graphics - This one is a odd one for me. There are moments that monster hunter wilds really shows its beauty and there are others where its...mundane and washed out completely. One of the final areas of the game is really beautiful and the early starting areas leave a lot to be desired. Overall the graphics I think are definitely good but I wouldn't call them...death stranding mind blowing good.Gear/Items - The gear in this game is AWESOME and fun to craft / hunt for. The build customization is varied and gives you a lot of options to play the game. There is a vast amount of weapons available to use that allow you to change up your play style and switch it up on the fly.Value - This game offers tremendous value between the hunts, gear farming and crafting, item upgrading and online play. You will be in this game for hundreds of hours easily and not even realize it.Cons:Stability / Performance - This game has massive performance and stability issues. I have a top tier rig, 4090 and all and even I would experience visual bugs and glitches, dropped frames during certain areas or actions and overall just not a super smooth experience the entire time. This thankfully wasn't often enough to make me stop playing, but when it happens it is in fact annoying as hell.Difficulty - Monster hunter veterans will probably have a issue with this game. I would'nt say this game is easier from a straight difficulty sense...I would say the game is more forgiving if that makes sense. It is the more forgiving nature that makes it easier compared to other Monster Hunter games. Veterans may have a issue with this however if you are new to MH, this would be for you.Overall I think this game is a great entry into the Monster Hunter franchise and I just hope the performance is fixed over time to allow a great experience to flourish properly.

The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one. Even switching to FSR and enabling frame gen DOES NOT HELP, as I can peak 90 fps but still chug down to 30 when turning my character around, making the dips even more jarring.Monster Hunter World looks gorgeous, miles better than Wilds, and runs at a rock solid 120+ fps, no dips, no stutters, no smeary PS2 textures, and no ai upscaling or generated frames.Elden Ring, a beautiful open world game runs buttery smooth with visuals that put this game to shame.Sadly both World and Elden Ring had performance issues at launch that had to be addressed through multiple patches, which seems to be the industry standard now. Hopefully the same happens with Wilds, but until then please DO NOT buy this game. Save yourself the time, energy, and money. I spent 2+ hours fiddling with settings and updating drivers for nothing.  I want to love this game, I really do, but in its current state I wouldn't play it even if it was free.

https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaymga/recommended/2246340/,"I really wanted this game to be good. I built a new PC primarily just to play this, so I won't speak of the performance issues as they didn't affect me at all. And there were also some positive things that stand out. Weapons feel smoother to play than ever, thanks to focus mode allowing to readjust where you are hitting, being able to skip the quest end countdown is something that was finally added as well, etc.But even considering that, there are just too many issues to wholeheartedly recommend the game.My main grievances are:1. Hunters have too much control. Thanks to the wound system basically adding a free stagger that any weapon can initiate at will so long as there is a wound makes the monsters look like clowns. Hunting Arkveld, the currently ""toughest"" monster in the game, is more akin to watching slapstick comedy. Between wound breaks, offset attacks, power clashes, flashes, regular topples, and natural traps if you use them, the monster spends more time on the ground or standing still than actively fighting. This also leads to hunts rarely taking longer than 10 minutes, usually averaging 7 at most.2. Monsters are not dangerous anymore. If a monster does actually manage to break out of a hunters CC chain, it is till no threat. Be it the generally low damage of monster attacks, the lack of blights, wind pressure, and god forbid tremor (a literal landwhale belly flop and we don't get tremored standing next to it?), there's nothing a well timed offset attack of guard doesn't solve.3. You cannot repeat the coolest fight in the game.You fight Zoh Shia once at the end of LR and that's it? No way to repeat the quest, no optional, no HR variant? We can't wear it's skin or use it's weapons? I'm sure i can hear the designers crying because they didn't get to make a nephilim themed armour with the whole Black and white theme going on in the fight.4. The absolute state of skills. I think the idea of taking a new approach to weapon and armour skills is nice. But the execution is severely lacking.Locking certain weapons into a skill that is just objectively unusable on it is ridiculous (looking at you, crit draw lances).But even if the skill would be usable, it might just straight up not work because a lot of them are bugged (e.g. Critical Element, Burst for HBG, ...). Locking a weapon into a specific skill is too restrictive either way in my opinion, but that's subjective.5. The artian system feels very lacklustre. These weapons are the best in the game for the most part. The actual look of the weapons is at best mid though, especially compared to the other weapons in the game which are absolute peak design. And even if artian weapons have different elements, they all look the same. The way you build them as well feels very shallow and not engaging at all. It never makes sense not to go for element, there is no downside to just going 3 of the same element, you can't forgo element for a boost in raw/crit/sharpness or whatever. You always aim for the same thing. And when enhancing, you mostly just hope for a bunch of attack. And if you are unlucky, all you have to do is chuck the weapon into the ether and try again.6. There is basically no endgame grind. The artian stuff feels like it was chucked on at the end just to have an excuse for an endgame. But in reality, parts are readily available from tempered quests that take no longer than regular hunts. If you are not planning on making a weapon of every type and element, you'll be done in no time at all.Same goes for decorations. It is obvious that the focus of grinding was supposed to be on something different compared to World. This in turn means, that getting all decorations is very quickly done as well, assuming RNGesus doesn't hate you. There is also no new mantles to unlock. You get a grand total of 4 thrown at you during the story and that's it. No doing all optional quests for a new mantle. Nothing.While writing this review, I realised that some of these decisions may be to make the barrier of entry for new players to the series easier. But I feel like that is no excuse to leave existing fans of the series by the wayside. In World, i really enjoyed struggling with my friends to find a way to beat a certain monster, or a hunt coming down to the wire with 2 unfortunate carts. I enjoyed finding ways to make certain grinds faster with the variety of tools we had at hand. Finding something new to work towards way into the endgame. In Wilds, there's just nothing.This game left a void in me. I was looking forward to it. I enjoyed playing through the story, albeit it feeling too easy, but I told myself ""Surely it will get harder in HR/Endgame"". And then I get to the end of HR. I beat Arkveld again. I am excited for what is to come when I hit HR50. What fight will be next? Will we get an elder dragon to fight? Zoh Shia again? What are these artian weapons preparing me for? And then ... nothing. I am left sitting in a mountain of unused relics, decorations and artian weapons. Okay, maybe it's HR60 this time around. I check. Nothing. There's nothing else to do. Hunt Arkveld 30 more times to reach HR100 to unlock more melding that I don't even need? That's it. That's the game done.It may sound like I don't like the game. That couldn't be further from the truth. I still love the game, I see the vision, and I am looking forward to what the game will become in the future.But right now, I just cannot give the game a positive review. I will revisit this review once we see some more content and these issues addressed.If you've read this far, thank you for tolerating my rambling. I'm done yelling into the void now.",Not Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/id/zebpai/recommended/2246340/,"Not recommended with its current state (v1.0).It's a good game (not great). My overall rating is 7/10. Wait until Title Update 4~5 first before buying.Some points of the review is in comparsion with the base game World and Rise when they were first released.First thing I'm gonna say is what I really like about the game.Focus Mechanic - With Focus Aim you can freely aim anywhere now. This helps a lot especially melee weapons.Offset Attacks and Power Clashes - Great way of parrying monster attacks and addition to perfect guards.Slinger Gathering - No need to go the herbs and pick them up.New way of story progression. Not just: Hub - Post Hub Quest - Hunt.With all the stuff below I hope all of them will get fixed and improve in the future updates!1. Optimization Issues.Game doesn't use the latest DLSS & DirectStorage versions for better and stable performance. For texture loading problems, it's as stated by one of the modders as well that capcom devs avoided using RAM/VRAM by streaming things when needed from storage instead of at boot time. All of these has been fixed by modders. And I hope Capcom will fix this on their side.2. Pop-Up Camps.There are a lot of QoL improvements but there are some changes that are questionable like the pop-up camps. What's the point of pop-up camps getting destroyed if you just need 75 points to fix them? And with the maps that are much larger than previous Monster Hunter games why not just make all the camps available and not have a limit of five. I do like that you can customize the camps now.3. Bad UX Design.First Alma (Quest/Lobby NPC)Before with the fixed Hub you always know where to go when you want to do a hunt or do something with the lobby. Because the NPC will not move and the NPC will always be there. Right now at least maybe more than half of the time since your Handler is the same as the Hub NPC, with her coming along with you on hunts, She will not always be beside the Base Camp Tent. She will most of the time walk around the Base Camp and you need to go look for her in order for you to interact with her.There is no bell sound anymore when someone posts a hunt in the lobby.Right now in order for you to get notified, when someone posted a hunt is through link party. Link party is good I'll be honest even when you are not in the same lobby you can still hunt with other link party members. But when you and your friends are in the same lobby and not in a link party there is no other way to know that someone posted a hunt aside from saying it through VC if you are in a call or manually typing it in game.Layered Armor/EquipmentBack in MH World when we got Layered Armor you could link your layered armor set with the equipment loadout you are equipping. But now in order for you to change equipment appearance you need to get out of the Change Equipment and Navigate to Equipment Appearance. This is about 10 button presses average if your equipment appearance loadout is in the first page. Also for the Appearance Menu, they should move the Change Appearance below the Equipment Appearance because you will not always change how your character(face) will look. When changing equipment appearance, me and most people I know accidentally pressed this most of the time instead of moving down below first. For listed menu designs you will always put first the ones that will mostly be chosen to the least one.In MH Rise the Layered Loadouts are in the Equipment Loadouts already. Even though they are not linked you can just switch between Equipment and Layered with LB/RB or L1/R1. They introduced Hunter Loadouts in Title Update 4 in Rise though. This is a loadout with equipment and layered link and an additional link for item loadout. This is really great especially for gunners since they have different ammos for different weapons.Raising KinsectThere is no Kinsect Tree. In order for you to know which Kinsect is better is after you nurture all of them. Back in World there are three tabs when you are crafting/updraging equipment and raising a kinsect. These are the list , tree and zoom view. Right now the one for Kinsect is default into a list view only.No Abandon Quest/No Mantle Reset on each Quest/InvestigationI get that mantles will continue to cooldown when you are doing a Field Survey but when you are doing a specific quest or investigation from Alma the cooldown should reset.This specific review is not for everyone. But mainly who do speedruns or testing some things on a specific quest.The only available option now is ""Return from Quest"" and doing that uses up everything that you did during the quest (i.e. might pill or traps). You need to replenish the items everytime you do the run again. You also need to wait for the mantles to cooldown. Thus making it inefficient to do runs.No Copy Lobby/Hunter IDThis is a simple feature to add and the Copy Session ID was already present in the Communication menu in World.There was also a shortcut key to view the Player List before in World when view the menu.Chat Log Notifications and how it disrupts viewing the MapThe game taught us and it has always been the select key to view the map even from the previous game. In Wilds if there are monster notifications in chat, the select key will be the shortcut to skip the monster and to view the map you need to hold the start key. Every UX Designer knows that this is just bad for ""Navigation Familiarity""4. Story and ProgressionWe all know that playing Monster Hunter games is always been the never ending hunting of monsters so I am fine with the story being so simple. I like how the story progresses now than before where you post the main story quest in hub and depart on the quest. I think they are moving close to a RPG type of main story progression with the maps connected to each other. And with locked out paths when you are being accompanied by NPC when you guys are riding a Seikret. And speaking of Seikret...5. SeikretSeikret AI is kinda junky at the moment. For sure this will be fixed in the future. Palamutes are the best. Change my mind.6. Endgame StuffGameDecoTalismanWeapon AugWorldRNGCraftableSelectable AugmentsRiseCraftableRNGSelectable Ramp Upgrades, you can ramp up upgrades every weapon not only rampage weaponsWildsRNGCraftableRNG, you can only reinforce Artian Weapons (Can save scum)Right now base endgame hunting, there is only one monster that is worth hunting with the rewards. And that is mostly Arkveld. For full hunt rewards he will get paired up with a random monster and that is a way for you to hunt a different monster aside from him. Half of my saved investigations are Arkveld since other monsters don't have the same amount of rewards. The other half are those monsters with their Gem as rewards. But if you already crafted a lot of equipments that needs a monster gem. You will just go back to Arkveld.Back in Base World you could always hunt almost every monster in High Rank since you are looking for Investigations with Gold Rewards and every monster investigation can have that reward. Also why couldn't we fightZoh Shia again. There's no available investigation you couldn't repeat assigned quests.Bounties.Before you could select bounties (optional subquests in Rise) that you want to do while hunting. And then choose a different bounty when you finish them.Now there is only Limited Bounty and they only reset weekly afaik.",Not Recommended
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003638963/recommended/2246340/,"Never in my mind did I ever think I'd have to, at any point in my life, write a negative review for a monster hunter game.As a disclaimer - I am not a hater. I LOVE the franchise. Started back in Tri, buying the game completely by accident. Just by the art on the cover box, having no idea what I am getting into.I fell in love with it, despite it's clunkyness and the game doing a poor job of explaining itself, but, by the time I finally fell my first Great Jaggi, I was hooked.The constant gameplay loop of killing a big monster, to make gear out of it, to prepare myself for yet another, even stronger monster - it's a magical code for my brain that keeps me coming back to this series.BUT... It's not present in this one. Game has amazing fundamentals. The movement never felt this good. The weapon movesets have never been this fluid.It's just a shame that all of it doesn't really matter, when the core aspect of a ""monster hunter"" game has been streamlined OUT of the game and now it's just a generic ""monster fighter"".Where as the series started as a ""hunting expierience"" with player having to commit on every step, because there were stakes - now there are no stakes and no commitment.Before, you had to prepare your pouch for the hunt, carefully chosing items and stocking up on them. You had to position well during combat, because if you just go out swinging hands, at best you could whiff an attack and deal no damage, at worst you would get punished by the monster and get hit instead (and remember, your amount of potions on a hunt was limited, so you're being tested my friend).Now, no matter if im running Dual Blades or Great Sword, as long as I am in range of the monster, it's gonna ALWAYS land, thx to the FOCUS mode, which ironically makes your brain lose focus, kinda zone out and let your hands just go through the motions. Feeling like you're fighting on autopilot, completely disengaged.Add to it the wound mechanic, which lets you stunlock the monster.The Palico that makes sure you don't have to bring healing items ever again and magically lays down a trap exactly at the moment that the monster is capturable.All those little things, and suddenly the game fails to provide any challenge.I could go on and on, but big content creators are finally catching up to what I've been heralding since World came out (because World started the trend, but wasn't nearly as sinful as this is) and they have already said everything.Mechanics such as wind pressure, tremors, seem to not exist. They probably do but I finished all the content (which is not a lot if you skip all the cutscenes and if you COULD skip all the walkie-talkie sections) and I don't remember wind pressure/tremors or such things happening at all.Now - before you come at me, I did watch all the cutscenes, I didn't skip a single one of them, but my friend wanting to catch up to me, did, and he finished ""the story"" in 7 hours, where as I did so in around 20, and it's never a good sign if 13 hours out of your entire 20 for A GAME are filled with cutscenes.I keep seeing these claims of the game's director that MH Wilds is a great success because of the story... No my friend. It's a great success despite the story, and mostly because World was a huge success. You are kind of getting the benefit of the doubt here, but you are quickly burning it.This game has very little to do with what an actual ""Monster Hunter"" series was always about.Expierience-wise: It's a game about hunting monsters, and as a hunter, preparing traps, tracking, doing what a hunter does.Gameplay-wise: Fight a monster, get it's parts, craft better armor, to be able to fight a bigger monster - that is what we would call ""gameplay loop"" in video game design, sadly, it's non-existant here.Monster Hunter has lost it's soul and it's an extremly sad thing to witness. Because this used to be one of my most beloved things in the world, alongside Zelda, Mario, Metroid, all these big, passion-filled creations. And now, one of them is getting destroyed.I might stick around to see Wilds getting it's G-rank expansion, but If the series doesn't change the course to revert some of it's streamlining, this might be the last monster hunter game I ever play.",Not Recommended

https://steamcommunity.com/id/valinypse/recommended/2246340/,"Comentario Analítico: ""Monster Hunter: Wilds""Se nos introdujo a la 6ta Generación de Monster Hunter el 27 de Febrero del 2025 por medio del estreno de Monster Hunter: Wilds, regresando a la dinámica y estética occidentalizada de World en lugar de la jugabilidad fugaz y estilo artístico Japonés de Rise.Jugablemente es un total acierto; el combate y la kinestesia es excesivamente gratificante, el Focus Mode es sencillo de entender, los pseudo-chocobos son aún más cómodos que los Canyne y el detalle con el que está dotado cada escenario es milimétrico.El ahora mundo abierto no se entiende como tal, en su mayoría vamos a trasladarnos por medio de viaje rápido y los recursos son recolectables a varios metros desde la montura; esto, sumado a saber siempre la localización de cada monstruo, puede significar un punto en contra para los habituados a las Investigaciones de World. Por suerte o por desgracia, quienes hayan sufrido los espantosos menús que esta franquicia lleva arrastrando durante décadas no tendrán que aprenderse nada nuevo, puesto que siguen siendo igual de horribles.Mientras que World se conservó relativamente complicado hasta la actualización del Deviljho, Wilds es asquerosamente sencillo incluso para novicios. Es cierto que aún estamos en las primeras semanas posteriores a su estreno y ya hay grandes actualizaciones anunciadas, pero por ahora es un paseo por el parque incluso haciendo una Challenge Run en High Rank.Ya todos sabemos que no hay quien juegue Monster Hunter por su historia, ahora en su mayoría presente en Low Rank y de mucho mayor peso e importancia que en cualquier título previo. No obstante aún sufre de grandes flaquezas, y si tanto nos quieren introducir a un mundo y a sus personajes, entonces deben hacerlo bien. Casi nada del argumento trata de monstruos nuevos, todo lo relativo a Gore Magala se presenta por la fuerza y la conclusión con Arkveld es demasiado inmediata. Quisiera encajarle varias trompadas a Nata pero es tan solo un niño; y aún así los adultos continúan llevándolo a la cuna de los peligros en zonas inexploradas, quizá sólo quieren deshacerse de él, no los culpo. ¡Por suerte volvió Poogie!Respecto a la gran polémica que lo arrastró a una valoración ""Variada"" en Steam; sí, Monster Hunter Wilds corre tan mal como corría Dragon's Dogma 2, del que se redujo recursos en pos del desarrollo de Wilds. Son dos juegos preciosos en términos artísticos, el RE Engine da lugar a una escenografía fabulosa y muy detallada, pero mal optimizada fuera de escenarios pequeños de la gama de Resident Evil 7/8 o Devil May Cry. Esperemos que aprendan de sus errores para REX Engine.¿En conclusión?Aislándonos de lo técnico, Wilds es un excelente sucesor.
